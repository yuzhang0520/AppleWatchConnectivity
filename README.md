# AppleWatchConnectivity
<p>An Apple Watch app that will use WatchConnectivity to  retrieve data from the iPhone it is paired with.</p>

<ul>
The phone will have a TableView listing out the following data for a 
car dealership:
  <li>Make</li>
  <li>Model</li>
  <li>Year</li>
  <li>Colour</li>
  <li>New/Used</li>
  <li>Price</li>
</ul>


• The data will come from a remote database and using PHP will download that data to the phone upon launching the iPhone app.<br>
• The iPhone app will then push the data to the watch for display there.<br>
• The iPhone app will have graphics to dress it up.<br>
• The Apple Watch app will use colour to dress it up.<br>
